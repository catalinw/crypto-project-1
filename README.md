# Crypto-API


## Run the application

In order to run the application, docker needs to be installed on your machine.
Run `make run` to run crypto-api and the postgres database in docker.

## Run tests

There are 2 types of tests written for the API: API tests that call the endpoints and integration tests for the challenge service.

Api tests:
- cucumber tests written using [godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog)
- these tests will call the real endpoints in the crypto-API
- in order to run the tests you have to run the application first
- run API tests using `make api-test`

Challenge service tests:
- integration tests for the challenge service 
- challenge repository is mocked
- business logic and expected calls to repository dependecy are validated  
- run integration tests `make test`

## Mocks

Dependency mocks generated by [mockgen](https://github.com/golang/mock)

If the dependencies change, re-generate the mocks by running command `make generate`

## Send requests to the application

Please import postman collection `welthee.postman_collection.json` in order to call crypto-API endppints.
